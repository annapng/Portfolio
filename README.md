## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria
[x] GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
[x] WHEN I load their portfolio
[x] THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
[x] WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
[x] THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
[x] WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
[x] THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
[x] WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
[x] THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
[x] WHEN I click on the images of the applications
[ ] THEN I am taken to that deployed application - (Will be updated with time!)
[ ] WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
[ ] THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport (Was not able to make the mobile version fully functional - will take the docked points and will come back to this project with more experience to do an overhaul. Decided I didn't want to get too behind in class and can always come back and update later)
